    "Text preprocessing is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) that converts raw, unstructured text into a clean, consistent format suitable for machine learning models. It addresses common issues like inconsistencies in encoding, noise from HTML tags or URLs, variations in case and punctuation, and linguistic complexities such as inflections or slang. By standardizing text, preprocessing reduces dimensionality, improves model accuracy, and enhances interpretability. However, it must be tailored to the task—over-aggressive cleaning can remove important signals (e.g., negators in sentiment analysis). Typical pipeline:\n",

    "\n",
    "Canonicalization is the process of converting text into a standard, consistent form to eliminate variations that arise from different encodings, character representations, or formatting quirks. In NLP, this step is essential because raw text data often contains inconsistencies like smart quotes (“ ”) instead of straight quotes (\" \"), accented characters in multiple forms, or mojibake (garbled text from encoding mismatches, e.g., \"cafÃ©\" instead of \"café\"). These variations can lead to inflated vocabulary sizes, poor tokenization, and reduced model performance by treating semantically identical strings as different.\n",

    "- **NFC (Normalization Form Canonical Composition)**: Composes characters into their canonical forms, useful for most text processing to ensure compatibility.\n",
    "- **NFKC (Normalization Form Compatibility Composition)**: Goes further by decomposing compatibility characters (e.g., full-width Latin letters to standard ones), which is often preferred for NLP to fold equivalences and reduce dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we apply light repairs with regex to handle common issues like excessive whitespace, fancy dashes (—, –), and quote variants. If the `ftfy` (Fix Text For You) library is installed, we leverage it for more robust fixes, such as correcting encoding errors, removing control characters, and normalizing line breaks. Without `ftfy`, we fall back to `unicodedata` and regex, which cover basic cases but may miss complex mojibake.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step ensures that downstream preprocessing (e.g., tokenization) operates on clean, uniform text, improving reproducibility and accuracy in tasks like classification or clustering.

    "\n",
    "**Learning objectives**\n",
    "- Understand the fundamentals of tokenization in NLP, including its role in breaking down text into manageable units.\n",
    "- Compare sentence-level tokenization (segmenting text into sentences) with word-level tokenization (splitting sentences into words or subwords).\n",
    "- Implement and apply custom tokenizer rules to handle special cases, such as preserving compound terms like `C++` or hyphenated words like `e-mail` as single tokens.\n",
    "- Recognize the trade-offs between rule-based tokenization and more advanced methods (e.g., subword tokenization in transformers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is a foundational step in text preprocessing that involves dividing raw text into smaller, meaningful units called tokens. These tokens can represent words, subwords, punctuation, or even entire sentences, depending on the granularity required for the task. Effective tokenization ensures that downstream processes like vectorization, modeling, and analysis operate on consistent, interpretable elements, reducing noise and improving model performance. Poor tokenization can lead to inflated vocabularies, loss of context, or misinterpretation of phrases (e.g., treating \"New York\" as two separate tokens when it should be one entity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentence Tokenization\n",
    "Sentence tokenization, also known as sentence segmentation, splits text into individual sentences. This is crucial for tasks that require understanding document structure, such as summarization, question-answering, or sentiment analysis at the sentence level. Libraries like spaCy use rule-based approaches combined with machine learning models to detect sentence boundaries based on punctuation (e.g., periods, exclamation marks) and linguistic cues (e.g., capitalization after punctuation). For example:\n",
    "- Input: \"I love Paris. It's beautiful!\"\n",
    "- Output: [\"I love Paris.\", \"It's beautiful!\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges include handling abbreviations (e.g., \"Dr.\" not ending a sentence) or informal text with ellipses. Over-segmentation can fragment related ideas, while under-segmentation might merge unrelated sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word Tokenization\n",
    "Word tokenization breaks sentences into words, subwords, or tokens, often treating punctuation as separate elements. This is the most common form of tokenization for bag-of-words models or embeddings. SpaCy's tokenizer employs a combination of rules, prefix/suffix patterns, and exception lists to handle complexities like contractions (\"don't\" → [\"do\", \"n't\"]) or compound words. For instance:\n",

    "### Custom Rules and Special Cases\n",
    "To enhance tokenization, custom rules can be added to spaCy's tokenizer to preserve specific patterns as single tokens. This prevents over-splitting of meaningful units, such as programming languages (\"C++\"), email formats (\"e-mail\"), or domain terms. For example, adding special cases ensures \"C++\" remains intact instead of being split into \"C\" and \"++\". This is done via `nlp.tokenizer.add_special_case()`, specifying the exact orthography and desired token structure. Custom rules improve accuracy for technical or specialized corpora but require careful tuning to avoid conflicts with general rules.\n",

    "In summary, tokenization bridges raw text and structured data, with sentence tokenization providing high-level structure and word tokenization enabling fine-grained analysis. Custom rules add flexibility for edge cases, but always validate on your dataset to ensure tokens align with semantic intent. Over-reliance on defaults can miss nuances, so iterate and test for your NLP task.\n"

In NLP preprocessing, removing stopwords helps reduce the dimensionality of feature spaces, improves computational efficiency, and focuses models on more informative terms.

    "# 9. Lemmatization vs. Stemming: Trade-offs & Demos\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning objectives**\n",
    "- Compare linguistic lemmatization with algorithmic stemming.\n",
    "- Understand when each is appropriate and their respective trade-offs in NLP preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatization and stemming are both techniques used to reduce words to their base forms, helping to normalize text by grouping together inflected or derived forms of a word. This reduces vocabulary size, improves model efficiency, and enhances the ability to match related terms in tasks like search, classification, or clustering. However, they differ significantly in approach, accuracy, and computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lemmatization\n",
    "Lemmatization is a linguistic approach that reduces words to their canonical or dictionary form (the lemma), taking into account the word's context, part of speech (POS), and morphological analysis. It uses language-specific rules and often relies on pre-trained models or lexicons to ensure the output is a valid word.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it works**: For example, \"running\" (verb) becomes \"run\", \"better\" (comparative adjective) becomes \"good\", and \"studies\" (noun) becomes \"study\". It distinguishes between different meanings based on POS (e.g., \"running\" as a verb vs. \"running\" as a gerund).\n",
    "- **Pros**: More accurate and linguistically sound, producing real words that preserve semantic meaning. Ideal for tasks requiring high precision, such as information retrieval or sentiment analysis.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Computationally intensive, as it requires POS tagging and access to linguistic resources. Slower on large datasets.\n",
    "- **When to use**: In applications where accuracy outweighs speed, like academic research, legal text analysis, or when working with morphologically rich languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stemming\n",
    "Stemming is an algorithmic approach that reduces words to their root form by heuristically removing suffixes and prefixes, often without considering context or POS. It's rule-based and language-agnostic, using algorithms like Porter, Snowball, or Lancaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it works**: For example, \"running\" becomes \"run\", \"better\" becomes \"bett\" (or similar, depending on the algorithm), and \"studies\" becomes \"studi\". It may produce non-words (stems) that aren't valid dictionary entries.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Fast and lightweight, requiring minimal resources. Effective for reducing dimensionality in large corpora.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Less accurate, as it can over-stem (e.g., \"university\" and \"universe\" both stem to \"univers\") or under-stem, leading to inconsistencies. Ignores linguistic nuances.\n",
    "- **When to use**: In high-volume, real-time applications like web search engines or preliminary data exploration, where speed is prioritized over precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trade-offs and Comparison\n",
    "- **Accuracy vs. Speed**: Lemmatization provides better semantic accuracy but is slower; stemming is quicker but cruder.\n",
    "- **Output Quality**: Lemmatization yields valid words; stemming often results in stems that may not be interpretable.\n",
    "- **Resource Requirements**: Lemmatization needs POS taggers and models (e.g., spaCy); stemming relies on simple rules.\n",
    "- **Task Suitability**: Use lemmatization for nuanced tasks (e.g., topic modeling with semantic coherence); use stemming for broad matching (e.g., keyword extraction in big data).\n",
    "- **Example Comparison**:\n",
    "\t- Word: \"better\", \"running\", \"studies\"\n",
    "\t- Lemmatization (spaCy): \"good\", \"run\", \"study\"\n",
    "\t- Stemming (Porter via NLTK): \"better\", \"run\", \"studi\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the choice depends on your dataset size, language, and task requirements. For English, spaCy offers robust lemmatization, while NLTK provides stemming options. Always evaluate on a sample to measure impact on vocabulary reduction and model performance.\n",

    "# 10. Handling Negation & Contractions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning objectives**\n",
    "- Expand common English contractions to standardize text and improve tokenization accuracy.\n",
    "- Implement a simple negation marking scheme to preserve sentiment polarity in downstream tasks like sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling negation and contractions is a nuanced step in text preprocessing that addresses linguistic phenomena where word forms can alter meaning or introduce ambiguity. These elements are particularly critical in tasks like sentiment analysis, where subtle changes (e.g., \"not good\" vs. \"good\") can flip polarity, or in information retrieval, where expanded forms ensure consistent matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expanding Contractions\n",
    "Contractions are shortened forms of words created by omitting letters and replacing them with an apostrophe (e.g., \"don't\" for \"do not\"). They are common in informal text like social media or conversational data but can complicate tokenization and normalization. Expanding them converts contractions back to their full forms, reducing variability and ensuring that models treat \"don't\" and \"do not\" equivalently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why expand?** Unexpanded contractions may be split incorrectly during tokenization (e.g., \"don't\" as \"don\" and \"'t\"), leading to inflated vocabularies or missed semantic connections. Expansion standardizes text, making it easier for lemmatization or vectorization.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Use a dictionary of common contractions (e.g., \"don't\" → \"do not\") and apply regex-based replacement to match whole words case-insensitively. This handles variations like \"Don't\" or \"DON'T\" without over-matching partial strings.\n",
    "- **Trade-offs**: Expansion increases text length slightly but improves consistency. For languages with fewer contractions, this step may be optional. Always test on your corpus to avoid introducing artifacts (e.g., in formal texts where contractions are rare).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negation Marking\n",
    "Negation involves words like \"not\", \"no\", or \"never\" that can invert the meaning of subsequent terms (e.g., \"not happy\" conveys unhappiness). In bag-of-words models, this scope is often lost, causing models to misclassify sentiment. Negation marking appends a suffix (e.g., \"_NEG\") to tokens within the negation scope, explicitly signaling the inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why mark negation?** It preserves polarity for sentiment tasks, preventing models from treating \"not good\" as positive. Without marking, vectorized representations might group \"good\" and \"not good\" similarly, harming accuracy.\n",
    "- **Simple scheme**: Identify negators and mark all following tokens until punctuation (e.g., \".\", \"!\", \"?\", \",\", \";\", \":\"). This resets the scope at sentence boundaries or clauses, approximating linguistic negation rules without complex parsing.\n",
    "- **Trade-offs**: This heuristic is lightweight and effective for short texts but may over-mark in complex sentences (e.g., \"I not only like it, but love it\"). For advanced needs, consider dependency parsing. Retain negators themselves to maintain context, and evaluate on labeled data to ensure it boosts performance without noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, apply contraction expansion before tokenization, and negation marking after stopwords removal to focus on content words. This step enhances model robustness, especially in opinion mining or review analysis, but should be tuned to your task—skip if negation isn't relevant (e.g., in topic modeling). Always combine with other preprocessing steps for a cohesive pipeline.\n"

    "- Map emojis to text (if `emoji` installed), handle emoticons and elongations.\n",
    "- Apply a tiny slang dictionary replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emojis, emoticons, elongations, and slang are common elements in informal text, especially from social media, chats, or user-generated content. These can introduce noise or convey nuanced sentiment/emotion that models need to handle appropriately. Preprocessing these elements standardizes them for better NLP performance, reducing variability while preserving meaning where possible. This step is optional but valuable for tasks like sentiment analysis or topic modeling on casual corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Emojis\n",
    "Emojis are pictorial symbols (e.g., 😋 for delicious food) that add emotional or contextual cues. Raw emojis can be treated as noise or special characters, leading to tokenization issues. If the `emoji` library is available, we can \"demojize\" them—convert to descriptive text (e.g., 😋 → \":face_savoring_food:\"). This maps visual elements to words, allowing models to process them as tokens. Without the library, emojis are left as-is or removed. This preserves sentiment (e.g., positive emojis in reviews) but increases vocabulary if not handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Emoticons\n",
    "Emoticons are text-based facial expressions (e.g., :) for happy, :( for sad) that mimic emotions. They are often inconsistent in format (e.g., :), :-), ;) ). We use regex to detect and replace them with a placeholder like \"__EMOTICON__\", masking their presence without losing the indication of emotion. This prevents over-splitting during tokenization and standardizes representation, useful for emotion detection tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalizing Elongations\n",
    "Elongations involve repeated characters for emphasis (e.g., \"Soooo relaxing\" for \"So relaxing\"). These can inflate token uniqueness. We apply regex to limit repeats (e.g., to 2 max), normalizing \"Soooo\" to \"Soo\". This reduces noise while retaining emphasis, improving model generalization without stripping stylistic intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Replacing Slang\n",
    "Slang abbreviations (e.g., \"imo\" for \"in my opinion\") are prevalent in informal text. A small dictionary maps them to full forms, standardizing language and aiding comprehension. This is lightweight and domain-specific—expand the dict for your corpus. It helps in tasks where precise meaning matters, like opinion mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "These transformations are applied after basic cleaning (e.g., canonicalization) and before tokenization. They enhance consistency in noisy data but should be tuned: e.g., keep emojis for sentiment, remove for factual tasks. Always test on samples to ensure they don't distort meaning. In the demo below, we chain these steps on a sample text.\n"

However, naive approaches (e.g., simple edit-distance algorithms or rule-based fixes) carry significant risks: they may over-correct valid terms (e.g., \"teh\" could be a name or slang), introduce errors in domain-specific jargon, or fail on context-dependent ambiguities. In noisy, informal datasets like social media, correction can distort meaning or remove stylistic elements (e.g., elongations for emphasis). Computational cost is another factor, as full correction requires dictionaries or models that slow down preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In production, specialized libraries like `pyspellchecker`, `autocorrect`, or transformer-based tools (e.g., via Hugging Face) are preferred, often combined with domain dictionaries to handle technical terms. For this educational demo, we use a very lightweight, illustrative method: a tiny whitelist of allowed words, combined with basic heuristics like dropping short or rare tokens. This simulates noise reduction without real correction, highlighting the concept's limitations. It's not recommended for real applications but serves to demonstrate pitfalls—always test on your corpus to avoid unintended data loss. If your data is clean or spelling isn't a major issue, skip this step entirely to preserve authenticity.\n"

    "# 13. Frequency-based Filtering & N-gram Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning objectives**\n",
    "- Understand how frequency-based parameters (`min_df`, `max_df`) filter terms to reduce noise and dimensionality in text vectorization.\n",
    "- Explore n-gram construction (`ngram_range`) to capture word sequences beyond single tokens, improving context for tasks like classification or topic modeling.\n",
    "- Observe the effects of these parameters on vocabulary size, feature sparsity, and model performance using scikit-learn vectorizers like `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency-based filtering and n-gram construction are advanced techniques in text preprocessing that refine the feature space created by vectorizers. They help balance between capturing meaningful signals and avoiding overfitting or computational inefficiency, especially in large or noisy corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-gram Construction\n",
    "N-grams are contiguous sequences of n items (typically words or tokens) from the text. They extend beyond single words (unigrams) to include phrases, providing richer context:\n",
    "- **Unigrams (1-grams)**: Individual tokens, e.g., [\"the\", \"cat\", \"sat\"].\n",
    "- **Bigrams (2-grams)**: Pairs of consecutive tokens, e.g., [\"the cat\", \"cat sat\"].\n",
    "- **Trigrams (3-grams)**: Triples, e.g., [\"the cat sat\"].\n",
    "- Higher-order n-grams capture more context but increase dimensionality exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ngram_range` parameter in scikit-learn vectorizers (e.g., `CountVectorizer`, `TfidfVectorizer`) specifies the range of n-grams to generate. For example:\n",
    "- `ngram_range=(1,1)`: Only unigrams.\n",
    "- `ngram_range=(1,2)`: Unigrams and bigrams.\n",
    "- `ngram_range=(2,3)`: Bigrams and trigrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Including n-grams can improve accuracy in tasks like sentiment analysis (e.g., \"not good\" as a bigram preserves negation) or named entity recognition, but it also expands the vocabulary, potentially leading to sparsity. On small datasets, higher n-grams may overfit; on large ones, they enhance generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequency-based Filtering\n",
    "To manage vocabulary size and remove uninformative terms, vectorizers apply document frequency thresholds:\n",
    "- **`min_df` (Minimum Document Frequency)**: Filters out terms that appear in fewer than `min_df` documents. This removes rare or noisy terms (e.g., typos or unique jargon) that don't generalize well.\n",
    "\t- Can be an integer (absolute count) or float (fraction of total documents, e.g., 0.01 for 1%).\n",
    "\t- Example: `min_df=2` excludes terms appearing in only 1 document.\n",
    "- **`max_df` (Maximum Document Frequency)**: Filters out terms that appear in more than `max_df` documents, targeting overly common terms that act like stopwords (e.g., \"the\" in most documents).\n",
    "\t- Can be an integer or float (e.g., 0.9 for 90% of documents).\n",
    "\t- Example: `max_df=0.8` removes terms in over 80% of docs, similar to custom stopword lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters reduce the feature space by eliminating low-information terms, improving computational efficiency and model interpretability. However, overly aggressive filtering (e.g., high `min_df` or low `max_df`) can discard useful signals, especially in imbalanced datasets. Always tune based on your corpus size and task—e.g., lower thresholds for sparse data, higher for noisy social media text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observing Effects\n",
    "In practice, experiment with these parameters to monitor changes:\n",
    "- **Vocabulary Size**: Increases with wider `ngram_range` (more n-grams) but decreases with stricter `min_df`/`max_df`.\n",
    "- **Sparsity**: Measured as the ratio of non-zero elements in the vectorized matrix. Higher n-grams and looser filters increase sparsity, potentially requiring more memory.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Use metrics like accuracy or F1-score on a holdout set to evaluate. For instance, bigrams might boost sentiment tasks but slow training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in the following cell demonstrates this by vectorizing the corpus with `ngram_range=(1,2)`, `min_df=1`, and `max_df=1.0`, then inspecting shapes, densities, and top TF-IDF terms. Try modifying these values (e.g., set `min_df=2` or `ngram_range=(1,3)`) to see the impact on outputs. This hands-on approach reinforces how preprocessing choices directly influence downstream NLP models.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Learning objectives**\n",
    "- Implement a configurable function and a small class to preprocess text consistently.\n",
    "- Add simple unit-like checks to validate preprocessing outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a reusable preprocessing pipeline is essential for maintaining consistency, reproducibility, and efficiency in NLP workflows. Instead of applying preprocessing steps ad-hoc in each script or notebook, encapsulating them into a configurable function or class allows you to standardize transformations across datasets, experiments, and team members. This approach minimizes errors, facilitates debugging, and supports iterative development—e.g., easily toggling options like lemmatization or emoji handling without rewriting code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline typically chains steps from earlier sections: canonicalization, structural cleaning, normalization, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and optional handling of negations, emojis, etc. A class-based design (e.g., with `fit` and `transform` methods, inspired by scikit-learn) enables fitting on training data (e.g., for corpus-level statistics) and transforming new texts uniformly. A simpler function can suffice for stateless preprocessing. Configuration via a dictionary ensures flexibility—e.g., set `{\"lemma\": True, \"keep_negators\": False}` to customize behavior per task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure reliability, include \"unit-like checks\": lightweight assertions or prints that verify outputs, such as checking for expected token counts, absence of unwanted elements (e.g., no raw URLs if masking is enabled), or vocabulary size reductions. These act as sanity checks, helping catch issues early without full model evaluation. In the demo below, we implement both a class (`Preprocessor`) and a helper function (`preprocess`), applying them to the corpus and inspecting results. This promotes best practices like modularity and testing, making your NLP pipeline robust and scalable. Always document configurations and test on edge cases (e.g., empty strings, mixed languages) to avoid surprises in production.\n"
